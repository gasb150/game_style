I create a rails app, according to [Nelson Sakwa on Behance](https://www.behance.net/sakwadesignstudio) design [liFEsTlye](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version), the user logs in to the app, the user is presented with the homepage
Each page uses the same top menu and footer, include links to pages that are implemented: Home, articles categories, write an article, and sing out. with featured article, with the biggest number of votes, with full-width image and title in the first row of home page.

    <!-- Screen shot -->

    2. List all categories in order of priority. Displayed as a square with its name on the top and its most recent article's title at the bottom. The background image is the image of the most recent article in this category.

    1. Articles are sorted by most recent, each article displays an image, title, truncated text as a preview, and its author username, with a button to add a vote for article (each user can vote only once).
